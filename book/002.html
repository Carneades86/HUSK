	 You know the crickets in the back field?
	</div>
	<div class="one2">
	 I was listening to their music the other day whilst raking, and I think they dipped into complex time 
	</div>
	<div class="one3">
	 I’m almost certain it was 5/3. They’ve kept it up all since
	</div>
	<div class="one4">
	 Well I suppose we should have come to expect such things, living next to the Forest of Jazz
	</div>
	<div class="one5">
	 What
	</div>
	<div class="one6">
	 Well it’s too late now, I’ve already written to Dizzie Gillespie inviting him to come down. He’ll be very disappointed; we were going to do the nature trail
	</div>
	<div class="one7">
	 The trail is open until November. I checked
	</div>
	<div class="one8">
	 Oh no
	</div>
	<div class="one9">
	 In that case I’ve invited David Gillespie round and he’s accepted 
	</div>
	<div class="one10">
	 Well so do I, but it’s done now. He was emphatic
	</div>
	<div class="one11">
	 Well that only leaves one possibility
	</div>
	<div class="one12">	
	 Peter Beardsley is coming next week
	</div>
	<div class="one13">
	 Still, we’re just forty minutes to Hereford. He’d like the Cathedral. Do you want to come hear the crickets now?
	</div>
	<div class="one14">
	 Subtler stresses, really
	</div>

		Yes

		<div class="two2">
		Ah
		</div>
		<div class="two3">
		That must have been difficult to follow
		</div>
		<div class="two4">
		It’s the Forest of Dean
		</div>
		<div class="two5">
		It’s the Forest of Dean, not the Forest of Jazz
		</div>
		<div class="two6">	
		I think you’ve made a mistake
		</div>
		<div class="two7">
		I mean Dizzie Gillespie is dead
		</div>
		<div class="two8">
		Yes
		</div>
		<div class="two9">	
		I think that’s a mistake
		</div>
		<div class="two10">	
		No, what I’m saying is, David Gillespie can’t read or write. He doesn’t know how to hold a pen
		</div>
		<div class="two11">		
		I know
		</div>
		<div class="two12">	
		He was an absolute nightmare last time. Said he only ate shop-bought
		</div>
		<div class="two13">
		Yes, okay. Are they like the syncopated cicadas we had in Greece?
