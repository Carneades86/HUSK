	 You know the crickets in the back field?
	 I was listening to their music the other day whilst raking, and I think they dipped into complex time 
	 I’m almost certain it was 5/3. They’ve kept it up all since
	 Well I suppose we should have come to expect such things, living next to the Forest of Jazz
	 What
	 Well it’s too late now, I’ve already written to Dizzie Gillespie inviting him to come down. He’ll be very disappointed; we were going to do the nature trail
	 The trail is open until November. I checked
	 Oh no
	 In that case I’ve invited David Gillespie round and he’s accepted 
	 Well so do I, but it’s done now. He was emphatic
	 Well that only leaves one possibility
	 Peter Beardsley is coming next week
	 Still, we’re just forty minutes to Hereford. He’d like the Cathedral. Do you want to come hear the crickets now?
	 Subtler stresses, really

		Yes
		Ah
		That must have been difficult to follow
		It’s the Forest of Dean
		It’s the Forest of Dean, not the Forest of Jazz
		I think you’ve made a mistake
		I mean Dizzie Gillespie is dead
		Yes
		I think that’s a mistake
		No, what I’m saying is, David Gillespie can’t read or write. He doesn’t know how to hold a pen
		I know
		He was an absolute nightmare last time. Said he only ate shop-bought
		Yes, okay. Are they like the syncopated cicadas we had in Greece?
