			It’s really quite simple. We were watching a hot air balloon, our defences were down, and a gang of them came at us from behind, bundled us into the back of a bicycle and rode off. I fainted with the shock, and the next I knew of it I was trapped in some kind of chamber
		</div>
	
	
		
	
	<div id="escapeText2">
	Escape? An accurate question. I was obviously helpless in the pitch darkness, unable to see enough to find the secret panels and levers that would have released me. After some moments of despair, I remembered the candle that I had intended to sell at the supermarket
</div>


<div id="escapeText3">
	I did my very best. I concentrated upon the wick with some vigour for minutes, but this yielded nothing. In the end, I generated heat by rubbing the hardened skin on my heels together. Under the power of this electric foot sandwich the candle soon burst into flame, and I was at last able to view my prison. 	
	</div>
	
	

	<div id="escapeText4">
		It became clear that I was in fact in a cardboard box. After a few minutes trying to work out how to escape without the key (a thorough search of the box had not yielded results) I simply decided to punch my way out. This I did with aplomb
</div>



<div id="escapeText5">
	Yes, Christ. Very much so Christ. There I stood, naked, triumphant, surrounded by cardboard carnage in a politely decorated spare bedroom.
</div>



<div id="escapeText6">
	I believed Yentob would be held close by, but I couldn’t call out for fear of bringing my captors back. I went out into the corridor, determined to find him, but was confronted with four doors as far as the eye could see. I knew I could never search them all. I chalked Yentob up to bad luck, and refocused on my own survival.
</div>



<div id="escapeText7">
	I did. But first, I had to wreak a terrible revenge. I wanted to write a series of demoralising slogans on slips of paper, to secrete in drawers and so forth, but I couldn’t find a pen. So I satisfied myself with bashing stuff up, starting with a piano.
</div>



<div id="escapeText8">
	Not really. I was very careful to destroy the keys along pentatonic scales, so it would have sounded like an improvisational study. 
	</div>
	


	<div id="escapeText9">
	When the time came, of course. But it was something of a Dutch auction on the stairs. After three steps I just ran for it, down the hall and into the kitchen, snatching a few handfuls of bread, then through the side gate, out into the street and away, blood and laughter streaming behind me.

	<div id="escapeText10">
	That candle would have got a good price
